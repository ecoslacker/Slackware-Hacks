This repository is a list of my few hacks in Slackware 14, mainly SlackBuilds. Some of my contributions
are just modifications of pre-existing scripts that I use. 

DISCLAIMER: Every script or patch that I put here is tested on my computer (Slackware 14 x86 or 32 bits).
If you want to use it or your machine use, with the same or different architecture and version, use it
on your own risk.
